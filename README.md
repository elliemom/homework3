Once clicked the button for "Generate Password", there would be a pop-up asking "How many characters would you like your password to contain?".
It also mentions that "Please enter a length of your password from 8-128." 
Otherwise, there will be an alert to inform that the length of password should be between 8 and 128.

Once you entered the number between 8 and 128, there would be several pop-ups asking to include lower case, upper case, numbers and special characters. 
If you want to include it, click "OK" and if you do not want to include it, click "cancel". 

After that, the password will be randomly generated with the length you typed in at the beginning.
